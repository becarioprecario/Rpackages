## Introduction

In this practical you will learn:

* The basic structure of `R` packages.

* How to create a simple `R` package.


## A simple `R` package

Given two vector $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and $y=(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$ of length $n$, their inner product
is defined as:

$$
<x, y> = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot y_i
$$

1. Write a simple function to compute the inner product:

    * The function will take two arguments (`x` and `y`).

    * The function must return a single value (i.e., the inner product).

2. Use `devtools` to create a simple package with this function:

    * Create the basic structure of the package.

    * Write the manual page of the function, inclusing a simple example.

3. Check the command to fix possible errors.
